I am currently working for [Eco Companion](https://ecocompanion.com){:target='_blank"}, a sustainable travels booking website running on **Ruby On Rails, MongoDB and Heroku**. I am the co-maintainer, hoster and developer of [Cirandas.net](http://cirandas.net){:target="_blank"}, a social and economic network built with Ruby On Rails and also lots of other languages and tools as it's too complex.

In my spare time, I practice **yoga** and **meditation** to reconnect with myself and help social projects and NGOs with technical support.
