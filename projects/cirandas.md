Cirandas.net is social network for solidarity economy in Brazil running on top of Noosfero, which is a free software created for social and economic networks. Noosfero also offers a full-featured CMS, making every user or community profile a complete Web site with several types of content (including text, image gallery, blogs, and file uploads), RSS feeds, agenda and more.

All the work involves deep knowledge of **Ruby, Rails, jQuery, RiotJS, PostgreSQL and Linux administration** (as this project is not supported right now, we host the site using our server with **Linux Containers, encryption, backup, postgres replication** and much more)

This is my biggest project. I've started it on 2011 and now I am a maintainer/DevOps of the whole platform. During these years, I co-built a community e-commerce for groups to order products directly from producers inside periodical cycles. In 2016, I rebuilt some of its interfaces using **RiotJS**, which is an inspired but faster version of ReactJS.

The idea behind this last refactor was to improve the **UX** during orders management with faster interfaces and more features.
