Eco Companion is a web platform focused on sustainable travels in nature. It uses **Ruby On Rails** with **MongoDB** on **Heroku**  
and my first challenge was to battle against a big performance issue. I am also developing tons of new features to the platform.

The site is [EcoCompanion.com](https://ecocompanion.com){:target="_blank"}

## An experience page.

![Listing page]({{ "/assets/img/projects/ecocompanion-listing.jpg" | prepend: site.base_url }})


As this is a private project, the code is **not** available.
