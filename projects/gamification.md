The Gamification is a plugin for the Noosfero platform to motivate people to interact with an APP of the Brazil's government for social participation in the politics. It uses the gem **merit** to account user actions in the system and to score them accordingly. For that, there was a big effort in creating a strong **unit test** for avoiding mistakes in the punctuation. As the front-end is a mobile *App*, the project involved creating also **API endpoints** for consuming the data.
