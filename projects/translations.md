This is an ongoing project for translating books and articles online collaboratively. It was started in the end of 2013 and stopped when it was close to have the first release. Recently, I restarted the project with the idea of replacing the views with *ReactJS*. The backend was created with **Rails 3.2** and was just migrated to **Rails 5.1** with **webpacker**


The code is available at [github](https://github.com/hugomelo/am-translations){:target="_blank"}.
